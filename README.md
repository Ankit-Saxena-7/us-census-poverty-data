# US CENSUS POVERTY DATA

Summary:
Extracting data from the US Census website and storing the data in a PostgreSQL database

How to execute the files:
* Run the Python code in the file __Solution.py__
* Follow the instructions in the comments
  * Copies of the Python data frames will be downloaded as Excel files for reference
  * The __Data__ folder contains these Excel files
* Connect to a local PostgreSQL database using the commands in the __Solution.py__ Python file
* Once connected, and all the commands in the __Solution.py__ file have been performed, execute the SQL commands in the __PostgreSQLCode.sql__ file in a PostgreSQL admin platform. I used pgAdmin from this [link](https://www.pgadmin.org/)
* The PDF __Database ERD.pdf__ contains an entityâ€“relationship diagram for the SQL schemas
